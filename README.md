# MediWatch
An clean HTML based static website to host and present my arduino project called MediWatch. MediWatch is a wristwatch that elderly or sick people can wear on a daily basis. The watch will  provide real time, two way communicate and alerts between the patient and their carer. Alerts include a fall detector, altitude, temperature and pressure readings and a pill consumption remineder.
